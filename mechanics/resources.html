                    <b>Resources</b> in board games are collections that might be spent or counted throughout the game, and are usually retained over multiple stages of the game. They can be a simple as money, which acts much like its real-world analogue - being the cost that you can give away at limited times and places to exchange for other objects or result. Resources are also often represenations of commodities like wood or gold. They may also have no utility and only represent your progress or achievements, for example points tokens. Often there a multiple resources in a game. Cards are also a common resource.
                    <br>Your resources might be hidden from other players or clearly visible to others. This might be achieved through a shield, or for cards by the card having a generic rear-side that does not reveal, some, or any information.
