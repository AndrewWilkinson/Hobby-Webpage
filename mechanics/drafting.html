                    <b>Drafting</b> is when a collection of resources is offered around players, who take a resources from that collection for their own use and then the next player in some order has a choice.
                    <br>A draft might be to take 1 or some items from a selection of singlular or groups of items. Or it might be to pass handfulls of options to players beside them after subtracting one from that handfull.
                    <br>All sorts of objects are drafted in various games: Cards, dice, tiles - are common examples.
                    <br>The collection drafted might be secretive, known only to the current draft, or openly visible to all.
                    <br>In "Azul" you take all of one colour from one of several circular placemats, which have been randomly filled.
